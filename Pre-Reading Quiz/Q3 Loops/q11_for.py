# A block of code needs to be repeated 5 times.

# What is the correct code to do this using a for loop?


# a. for i in range(5): # Correct
# b. for (int i=0; i<5; i++)
# c. for i in range(6):
# d. for i in range(4):


for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++):
# for i in range(6):
# for i in range(4):

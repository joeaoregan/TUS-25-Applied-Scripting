# The variable count is initialised to zero.
# What's the correct way to use it to repeat a code block 3 times using a while loop?
# a. while count <= 3:
# b. if count < 3:
# c. while count < 4: 
# d. while count < 3: # Correct


count = 0

while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1


# while count <= 3:
# if count < 3:
# while count < 4:

# A username must have between 4 and 8 characters (inclusive).

# Which of the following is the Pythonic code for a condition to the check if 
# the value of username contains a suitable number of characters?

# a. 4 <= len(username) <=8 # Correct
# b. len(username) >= 4 or len(username) <= 8
# c. len(username) >=4 and len(username) <= 8
# d. not len(username) < 4 and not len(username) > 8

username = "joeregan"
print(4 <= len(username) <=8) # This = Pythonic

# print(len(username) >= 4 or len(username) <= 8) # Not correct

# print(len(username) >= 4  and len(username) <= 8) # OK

# print(not len(username) < 4 and not len(username) > 8) # OK

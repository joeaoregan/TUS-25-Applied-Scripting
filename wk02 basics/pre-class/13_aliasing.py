# Aliasing

# You can change the names of modules and their features 
# using the as keyword:
#  • To avoid name conflicts
#  • To abbreviate long names
#  • To avoid name conflicts, where features from 
#    different modules have the same name:

import socket as sk

# help(socket) # NameError: name 'socket' is not defined
